    "authors": "Baoyang Zhang, Zhen Lu, Yaomin Zhao, Yue Yang",
    "abstract": "Quantum computation offers potential exponential speedups for simulating certain physical systems, but its application to nonlinear dynamics is inherently constrained by the requirement of unitary evolution. We propose the quantum Koopman method (QKM), a data-driven framework that bridges this gap through transforming nonlinear dynamics into linear unitary evolution in higher-dimensional observable spaces. Leveraging the Koopman operator theory to achieve a global linearization, our approach maps system states into a hierarchy of Hilbert spaces using a deep autoencoder. Within the linearized embedding spaces, the state representation is decomposed into modulus and phase components, and the evolution is governed by a set of unitary Koopman operators that act exclusively on the phase. These operators are constructed from diagonal Hamiltonians with coefficients learned from data, a structure designed for efficient implementation on quantum hardware. This architecture enables direct multi-step prediction, and the operator's computational complexity scales logarithmically with the observable space dimension. The QKM is validated across diverse nonlinear systems. Its predictions maintain relative errors below 6% for reaction-diffusion systems and shear flows, and capture key statistics in 2D turbulence. This work establishes a practical pathway for quantum-accelerated simulation of nonlinear phenomena, exploring a framework built on the synergy between deep learning for global linearization and quantum algorithms for unitary dynamics evolution.",

    "title": "diffSPH: Differentiable Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics for Adjoint Optimization and Machine Learning",
    "authors": "Rene Winchenbach, Nils Thuerey",
    "abstract": "We present diffSPH, a novel open-source differentiable Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) framework developed entirely in PyTorch with GPU acceleration. diffSPH is designed centrally around differentiation to facilitate optimization and machine learning (ML) applications in Computational Fluid Dynamics~(CFD), including training neural networks and the development of hybrid models. Its differentiable SPH core, and schemes for compressible (with shock capturing and multi-phase flows), weakly compressible (with boundary handling and free-surface flows), and incompressible physics, enable a broad range of application areas. We demonstrate the framework's unique capabilities through several applications, including addressing particle shifting via a novel, target-oriented approach by minimizing physical and regularization loss terms, a task often intractable in traditional solvers. Further examples include optimizing initial conditions and physical parameters to match target trajectories, shape optimization, implementing a solver-in-the-loop setup to emulate higher-order integration, and demonstrating gradient propagation through hundreds of full simulation steps. Prioritizing readability, usability, and extensibility, this work offers a foundational platform for the CFD community to develop and deploy novel neural networks and adjoint optimization applications.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning provides a versatile suite of methods for extracting structured information from complex datasets, enabling deeper understanding of underlying fluid dynamic phenomena. The field of turbulence modeling, in particular, benefits from the growing availability of high-dimensional data obtained through experiments, field observations, and large-scale simulations spanning multiple spatio-temporal scales. This report presents a concise overview of both classical and deep learningbased approaches to turbulence modeling. It further investigates two specific challenges at the intersection of fluid dynamics and machine learning: the integration of multiscale turbulence models with deep learning architectures, and the application of deep generative models for super-resolution reconstruction",

    "authors": "Shaofan Wang, Nils Thuerey, Philipp Geyer",
    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient prediction of indoor airflow and temperature distributions is essential for building energy optimization and occupant comfort control. However, traditional CFD simulations are computationally intensive, limiting their integration into real-time or design-iterative workflows. This study proposes a component-based machine learning (CBML) surrogate modeling approach to replace conventional CFD simulation for fast prediction of indoor velocity and temperature fields. The model consists of three neural networks: a convolutional autoencoder with residual connections (CAER) to extract and compress flow features, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to map inlet velocities to latent representations, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) as an aggregator to combine single-inlet features into dual-inlet scenarios. A two-dimensional room with varying left and right air inlet velocities is used as a benchmark case, with CFD simulations providing training and testing data. Results show that the CBML model accurately and fast predicts two-component aggregated velocity and temperature fields across both training and testing datasets.",

    "title": "Optimizing Metachronal Paddling with Reinforcement Learning at Low Reynolds Number",
    "authors": "Alana A. Bailey, Robert D. Guy",
    "abstract": "Metachronal paddling is a swimming strategy in which an organism oscillates sets of adjacent limbs with a constant phase lag, propagating a metachronal wave through its limbs and propelling it forward. This limb coordination strategy is utilized by swimmers across a wide range of Reynolds numbers, which suggests that this metachronal rhythm was selected for its optimality of swimming performance. In this study, we apply reinforcement learning to a swimmer at zero Reynolds number and investigate whether the learning algorithm selects this metachronal rhythm, or if other coordination patterns emerge. We design the swimmer agent with an elongated body and pairs of straight, inflexible paddles placed along the body for various fixed paddle spacings. Based on paddle spacing, the swimmer agent learns qualitatively different coordination patterns. At tight spacings, a back-to-front metachronal wave-like stroke emerges which resembles the commonly observed biological rhythm, but at wide spacings, different limb coordinations are selected. Across all resulting strokes, the fastest stroke is dependent on the number of paddles, however, the most efficient stroke is a back-to-front wave-like stroke regardless of the number of paddles.",
