    "abstract": "Neural operators have emerged as powerful deep learning frameworks for approximating solution operators of parameterized partial differential equations (PDE). However, current methods predominantly rely on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) for mapping inputs to solutions, which impairs training robustness in physics-informed settings due to inherent spectral biases and fixed activation functions. To overcome the architectural limitations, we introduce the Physics-Informed Chebyshev Polynomial Neural Operator (CPNO), a novel mesh-free framework that leverages a basis transformation to replace unstable monomial expansions with the numerically stable Chebyshev spectral basis. By integrating parameter dependent modulation mechanism to main net, CPNO constructs PDE solutions in a near-optimal functional space, decoupling the model from MLP-specific constraints and enhancing multi-scale representation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the Chebyshev basis's near-minimax uniform approximation properties and superior conditioning, with Lebesgue constants growing logarithmically with degree, thereby mitigating spectral bias and ensuring stable gradient flow during optimization. Numerical experiments on benchmark parameterized PDEs show that CPNO achieves superior accuracy, faster convergence, and enhanced robustness to hyperparameters. The experiment of transonic airfoil flow has demonstrated the capability of CPNO in characterizing complex geometric problems.",

    "title": "WAKESET: A Large-Scale, High-Reynolds Number Flow Dataset for Machine Learning of Turbulent Wake Dynamics",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) offers transformative potential for computational fluid dynamics (CFD), promising to accelerate simulations, improve turbulence modelling, and enable real-time flow prediction and control-capabilities that could fundamentally change how engineers approach fluid dynamics problems. However, the exploration of ML in fluid dynamics is critically hampered by the scarcity of large, diverse, and high-fidelity datasets suitable for training robust models. This limitation is particularly acute for highly turbulent flows, which dominate practical engineering applications yet remain computationally prohibitive to simulate at scale. High-Reynolds number turbulent datasets are essential for ML models to learn the complex, multi-scale physics characteristic of real-world flows, enabling generalisation beyond the simplified, low-Reynolds number regimes often represented in existing datasets. This paper introduces WAKESET, a novel, large-scale CFD dataset of highly turbulent flows, designed to address this critical gap. The dataset captures the complex hydrodynamic interactions during the underwater recovery of an autonomous underwater vehicle by a larger extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle. It comprises 1,091 high-fidelity Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, augmented to 4,364 instances, covering a wide operational envelope of speeds (up to Reynolds numbers of 1.09 x 10^8) and turning angles. This work details the motivation for this new dataset by reviewing existing resources, outlines the hydrodynamic modelling and validation underpinning its creation, and describes its structure. The dataset's focus on a practical engineering problem, its scale, and its high turbulence characteristics make it a valuable resource for developing and benchmarking ML models for flow field prediction, surrogate modelling, and autonomous navigation in complex underwater environments.",
